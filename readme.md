### Overview
This course is the second part of the specialization [MATLAB Programming for Engineers and Scientists Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/matlab-programming-engineers-scientists), offered by Vanderbilt University.
It covers more advanced MATLAB programming concepts such as **recursion**, **vectorization**, **function handles**, **algorithm complexity and efficiency**, **error handling**, etc..
It also presents many powerful features of MATLAB including **object-oriented programming**, **graphical user interface design environment (App Designer)** and **Live Scripts**.

### Final Project

In the final project of this course, I used object-oriented programming techniques and developed a MATLAB application with professional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that visualize COVID-19 pandemic data from around the world.
I did enjoy doing this project as it's a good chance to apply newly learned skills to a real world problem. :)
The data obtained from the [Coronavirus Resource Center at the Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) is available from the `covid_data.mat` file.
